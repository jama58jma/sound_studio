        <h1>1. INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>This Safety Protocol establishes the mandatory procedures and rules for the safe operation of all audio, recording, and monitoring equipment within the sound studio. Its purpose is to prevent injuries, protect personnel, and ensure the continuous and reliable operation of studio systems. All staff, students, and visitors must understand and comply with these safety requirements before entering or using the facility. Failure to follow these rules may result in equipment damage, personal harm, or disciplinary action.</p>
        <p>The protocol applies to all areas of the studio, including the control room, live room, isolation booths, equipment storage spaces, and any associated technical workstations. Because audio studios involve electrical equipment, elevated sound levels, manual handling tasks, and environmental hazards, users must be aware of the risks and follow the preventive measures described in this document.</p>
